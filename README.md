# Global-Suicide-Rates-Analsyis

Welcome to the **Global Suicide Rates Analysis** project. This project leverages **data mining and machine learning techniques** to analyze and predict global suicide trends across different **countries, years, age groups, and economic conditions**.

---

## **1. Introduction**
### **Purpose**
This project aims to analyze **global suicide rates from 1985 to 2016** using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning models**. By understanding the correlation between **demographic, economic, and social factors**, this study can support **mental health policies and intervention strategies**.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Programming & Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes
- **Data Source:** [Kaggle - Suicide Rates Overview 1985-2016](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-2016)

---

## **2. Dataset Overview**
The dataset consists of **27,820 rows and 12 columns**, providing suicide statistics for **101 countries** from **1985 to 2016**.

### **üìä Dataset Columns**
| Column | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **country** | Name of the country |
| **year** | Year of record (1985 - 2016) |
| **sex** | Gender of the individual (Male/Female) |
| **age** | Age group (e.g., 15-24, 35-54, 75+) |
| **suicides_no** | Number of reported suicides |
| **population** | Population size for that country-year-age group |
| **suicides/100k pop** | Suicide rate per 100,000 people |
| **country-year** | Unique identifier for each country-year entry |
| **HDI for year** | Human Development Index (HDI) for that year (some missing values) |
| **gdp_for_year ($)** | Total GDP for the country (in USD) |
| **gdp_per_capita ($)** | GDP per person (economic indicator) |
| **generation** | Generation classification (Silent, Boomer, Gen X, Millennials, etc.) |

---

## **3. Data Preprocessing**
Before applying machine learning models, extensive **preprocessing** was performed:
- **Handling Missing Values:** `HDI for year` contained missing values, which were filled using **backward fill (bfill)**.
- **Outlier Detection & Removal:** Used **Interquartile Range (IQR)** to remove extreme outliers.
- **Data Cleaning:** Converted `gdp_for_year ($)` to an **integer** format by removing commas.
- **Categorical Feature Encoding:** Converted string features (`country`, `sex`, `age`, `generation`) into numerical values.
- **Feature Scaling:** Used **Min-Max Normalization** to scale numeric features.

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
We conducted **in-depth analysis** of the dataset to uncover **suicide patterns**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Gender-based Trends:**  
   - **Male suicide rates** are consistently **higher** than female rates.  
   - Suicide rates vary across **different generations**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Age-based Trends:**  
   - **Elderly individuals** (75+ years) have **higher suicide rates**.  
   - **Young adults (15-24 years)** show concerning trends in certain regions.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Economic & Social Factors:**  
   - Countries with **higher GDP per capita** generally have **lower suicide rates**.  
   - **HDI (Human Development Index)** correlates with suicide trends.  
   - Developed countries show **higher suicide rates**, possibly due to **mental health pressures, work stress, and psychiatric illness prevalence**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Time-based Trends:**  
   - Suicide rates **fluctuate** over the years.  
   - Economic **recessions (e.g., 2008 financial crisis)** impact suicide trends.  
   - Countries like **Japan, Russia, and South Korea** have **higher suicide rates** than others.

## **5. Machine Learning Models**
We implemented multiple **supervised learning models** to predict **suicide rates** based on demographic and economic indicators. The models used include:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚úÖ *(Best performing model)*
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Na√Øve Bayes**
- **Linear Regression** *(Not ideal for this dataset)*
- **Multiple Linear Regression** *(High error rates due to data complexity)*

### üîç **Key Findings**
- **KNN performed the best**, effectively predicting suicide rates with the lowest error.
- **Economic and demographic factors** (GDP per capita, HDI, age group) significantly impact suicide trends.
- **Linear Regression models did not perform well** due to the **non-linear relationships** in the dataset.

## **6. Key Results & Model Performance**
### ‚úÖ **Major Findings**
‚úî **Economic indicators (GDP per capita, HDI) significantly impact suicide rates**  
‚úî **Males are at a higher risk of suicide than females globally**  
‚úî **Older age groups (55+ years) show the highest suicide rates across multiple regions**  
‚úî **Economic downturns (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis) correlate with increased suicide rates**  

### üìä **Model Performance & Evaluation**
We tested multiple **machine learning models** for **suicide rate prediction**, and the **best-performing model was K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** due to its adaptability to non-linear relationships in the dataset.

#### **üìå Models Used**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚úÖ *(Best performing model)*
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Na√Øve Bayes**
- **Linear Regression** *(Not ideal for this dataset)*
- **Multiple Linear Regression** *(High error rates due to data complexity)*

#### **üìå Model Comparison**
| **Model** | **Best Use Case** | **Limitations** |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚úÖ | Best accuracy, works well with non-linear relationships | Sensitive to feature scaling |
| **Decision Tree** | Easy to interpret, good for feature importance | Can overfit without pruning |
| **Random Forest** | Handles large datasets well, reduces overfitting | Computationally expensive |
| **Logistic Regression** | Works for binary classification | Struggles with complex relationships |
| **Na√Øve Bayes** | Fast and efficient for simple patterns | Assumes feature independence |
| **Linear Regression** | Good for linear relationships | Fails due to non-linearity in data |
| **Multiple Linear Regression** | Accounts for multiple predictors | High error due to dataset complexity |

### üìå **Feature Importance (Derived from Decision Tree & Random Forest)**
The top predictors of suicide trends were:
1. **GDP per capita ($)** ‚Üí Strong negative correlation with suicide rates.
2. **Human Development Index (HDI)** ‚Üí Lower HDI countries had higher suicide rates.
3. **Age Group** ‚Üí Older individuals had significantly higher suicide rates.
4. **Sex (Male/Female)** ‚Üí Male suicides were disproportionately higher than female.
5. **Economic downturns** ‚Üí Financial crises led to an increase in suicides across regions.
